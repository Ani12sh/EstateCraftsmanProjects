# Project Statement:

Within the realm of real estate, the importance of a project manager's role in ensuring projects adhere to schedules and budgets is sometimes underestimated. In the past, there may have been instances where project managers needed to justify their presence on a project site. However, the current pay structures and incentives tied to successful project completion underscore the demonstrated value of project managers over time.

# Project Description:
Real estate is defined as tangible property comprising land and anything affixed to or constructed on it, whether of natural or human origin. There are five primary classifications of real estate: residential, commercial, industrial, raw land, and special use. Real estate investment involves acquiring a residence, rental property, or land. Alternatively, indirect investment in real estate can occur through Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) or pooled real estate investment.
